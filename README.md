# SVM-Iris-Classification
A classification project using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze and predict species from the Iris dataset. This project explores the SVM algorithm and its applications in discriminant analysis, using features such as sepal and petal dimensions to classify different Iris species.

# SVM Iris Classification Project

This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify different species within the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic example for testing classification algorithms, as it contains three different classes of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor, with four features per sample.

## Project Overview
In this project, we use the SVM algorithm to predict the species of Iris based on measurements of sepals and petals. This project helps understand SVM's discriminative ability and the importance of selecting appropriate kernels for effective classification.

## Dataset
